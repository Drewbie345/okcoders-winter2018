### Using Twitter Bootstrap

Your mission is to recreate the static site below using your knowledge of HTML and CSS (and your ability to Google what you don't know!).

Focus on recreating the layout (if you need to use different icons/colors/etc. that's fine). I've included images in Eterna-Project folder that you can use or choose your own.
